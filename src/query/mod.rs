//! Queries are used to fetch data from the [`World`].
//!
//! Basic query types are `&T`, `&mut T`, and `Entities`.
//! `&T` fetches component `T` for reading. It yields `&T`, so it also
//! filters out entities that don't have component `T`.
//! `&mut T` fetches component `T` for writing. And filters same way as `&T`.
//! `Entities` fetches [`EntityId`]s. All entities have an ID,
//! so it doesn't filter anything.
//!
//! Queries are divided into two categories: stateful and stateless.
//!
//! Stateful queries implement `Query` trait and are passed into methods by value.
//! Some of them have `DefaultQuery` implementation, and can be used in methods
//! that do not accept query as an argument and only as a type parameter.
//!
//! Stateless queries implement `PhantomQuery` trait, and `PhantomData<Q>`
//! is stateful counterpart for stateless query `Q`.
//!
//! All basic queries are stateless.
//! Advanced queries like `Modified` - that filter entities based on
//! component modification - and `RelatedTo` - that filter entities based on
//! entity relation - are stateful.
//!
//! Queries can be combined into tuples producing a new query that yields
//! a tuple of items from the original queries and filtering out entities
//! that don't satisfy all queries.
//!
//! TODO: Derive impl for structures with named fields.
//!
//!
//! Queries can be used with [`World`] to produce a [`View`].
//! A [`View`] can be iterated to visit all matching entities and fetch
//! data from them.
//! [`View`] can also be indexed with [`Entity`] to fetch data from
//! a specific entity.
